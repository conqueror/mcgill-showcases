# Learning Guide

1. Run `make run` and inspect feature importance rankings.
2. Compare subgroup metrics in `artifacts/fairness/group_metrics.csv`.
3. Read disparity gaps in `artifacts/fairness/disparity_summary.md`.
4. Run `make run-mitigations` and compare strategy tradeoffs.

Reflection prompts:
- Which fairness metric changed most across mitigation strategies?
- Which performance metric was most sensitive to mitigation?
