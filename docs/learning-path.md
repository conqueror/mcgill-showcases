2. `projects/sota-unsupervised-semisup-showcase`
3. `projects/causalml-kaggle-showcase`

## Path B: Decision Science / Causal Focus
1. `projects/causalml-kaggle-showcase`
2. `projects/sota-supervised-learning-showcase`
3. `projects/sota-unsupervised-semisup-showcase`

## Path C: Short Course (One Week)
- Day 1-2: supervised showcase
- Day 3-4: causal showcase
- Day 5: unsupervised/semisup showcase summary

## How To Know You Are Progressing
- You can explain outputs in plain language.
- You can justify model choices with evidence.
- You can describe one limitation or risk per method.
