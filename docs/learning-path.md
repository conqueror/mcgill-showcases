## How To Know You Are Progressing
- You can explain outputs in plain language.
- You can justify model choices with evidence.
- You can describe one limitation or risk per method.
- You can propose a production or governance guardrail for each modeling workflow.

## Coverage Cross-Reference
Use `docs/aspect-coverage-matrix.md` to confirm which project demonstrates each method (splits, imbalance handling, explainability, HPO, tracking, and productionization).

## Track Pages
