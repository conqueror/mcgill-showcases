# McGill ML Showcases Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for `mcgill-showcases`.

This repo is organized as learning-by-doing showcase projects with reproducible scripts, clear artifacts, and track-based progression paths.

## Start Here

1. Run local setup from `README.md` or `docs/getting-started.md`.
2. Pick a track based on your goal.
3. Run one showcase end-to-end.
4. Interpret generated artifacts with `docs/aspect-coverage-matrix.md`.

## Learning Tracks

- Foundations: core supervised, unsupervised, EDA, and feature engineering workflows.
- Production: serving, drift monitoring, rollout decisions, and system patterns.
- Ranking: grouped ranking modeling and API productization.
- Forecasting: time-aware demand modeling and observability-ready APIs.
- Responsible AI: fairness, explainability, and causal decision support.
- Optimization: HPO and policy optimization workflows.
